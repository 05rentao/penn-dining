Hi!

I implemented my Penn dining app, mainly inspired by the UI of PennMobile, but I still sprinkled in a few changes.

In particular, I implemented a rating feature, where you could rate each dining hall's food for the day. I had the idea that students could have a way of crowdsourcing where the food was good. I included this feature in the homescreen rowView as well I wasn't able to fully flush out this idea due to time constraints(making up some fake data, filter dining hall by rating)

Additionally, I was also trying to implement a share feature where you'd be able to share the dining hall with a friend, and sorta "make plans" via the share-prompted text message you can send to someone. I'm not sure whether it works well functionally, I wasn't able to test it on my phone.

I was trying to implement a LocationView using MapKit UI, but since I didn't have the full address, I'd had to download some packages and that wasn't possible for me. Therefore I settled on a link to AppleMaps that could be used as directions.

I used ChatGPT's help in this application, mainly to debug stuff like simulators not running. I used it for the messenger feature as I didm't quite grasp the documentation. I also used to to create mock data based on the JSON files.
